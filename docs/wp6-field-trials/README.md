WP6 Field Trials
----------------
> Hitting the ground running!

* [Overview][overview]. Lunar-orbit view of WP6 field trials.
* [Injection moulding][injection-moulding]. In this deployment Fatigue
  monitoring system, Intervention Manager and Sensing Layer will orchestrate
  robots and operators in Ghepi's injection moulding process to reduce
  operator stress levels and fatigue as well as increasing overall
  productivity.
* [Fastener sorting][fastener-sorting]. AI for Quality Systems will enhance
  Dimac's capability to detect faulty parts early in the manufacturing
  process.
* [Hand tools][hand-tools]. Vision for Quality Excellence and Shop Floor
  Anomaly Detection System will provide an almost entirely automated
  solution to Ideal Tek’s problem of assessing whether product features,
  such as dimensions, conform to specifications.
* [Electrical equipment][electrical-equipment]. Shop Floor Anomaly Detection
  System and Intervention Manager will help Wamtechnik’s engineers to optimise
  battery production thanks to real-time quality assessment and reconfiguration
  recommendations.
